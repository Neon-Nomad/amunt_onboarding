# Amunet AI Backend

This directory contains the Express.js backend for the Amunet AI application.

## Setup

1.  Navigate into this directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  This server relies on the Gemini API Key being available as an environment variable (`API_KEY`). Ensure it is set in your execution environment.

## Running the Server

```

The server will start on port 3001 by default and will automatically restart when you make changes to the source code.
